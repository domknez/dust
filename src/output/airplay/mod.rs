//! AirPlay sender: RTSP control, RTP/UDP audio as uncompressed ALAC, timing,
//! sync packets and retransmits.
//!
//! Two handshakes share that streaming core:
//! - AirPlay 2 (devices with CoreUtils pairing, e.g. Sonos Era, HomePod): transient
//!   HomeKit pairing, encrypted RTSP, binary-plist SETUP, PTP timing,
//!   ChaCha20-Poly1305 audio.
//! - AirPlay 1 / RAOP with unencrypted audio (`et=0`): AirPort Express, older
//!   speakers, shairport-sync classic.
//!
//! - [`discovery`]: finding speakers over mDNS
//! - [`sink`]: [`AirPlaySink`], the audio output
//! - [`negotiate`]: the AirPlay 1 / AirPlay 2 session handshakes
//! - [`rtsp`]: the (optionally encrypted) RTSP client
//! - [`packets`]: wire formats (ALAC frames, RTP, sync and timing packets)
//! - [`transport`]: the network threads (audio pacing, timing, retransmits)
//! - [`ap2`]: AirPlay 2 building blocks (pairing, plists, PTP clock)
//! - [`dacp`]: remote control from the speaker's buttons
